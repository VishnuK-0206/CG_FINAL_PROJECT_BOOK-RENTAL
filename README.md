ABSTRACT:

The advent of digital technology has transformed the way we consume content, including books. However, physical books still hold a special place in the hearts of many readers. To bridge the gap between traditional and digital reading experiences, this project proposes the development of a Book Renting Platform using the MERN
The Book Renting Platform aims to bridge the gap between traditional and digital reading by offering a seamless online interface for book enthusiasts. This platform aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient solution for individuals who prefer physical books while also promoting sustainability by reducing the environmental impact of book production and distribution. Users can create accounts, browse a catalogue of available books, intuitive search, rent them, and return them once finished
By leveraging modern web technologies and user-centred design principles, this project aims to provide a seamless and enjoyable book renting experience. It encourages sustainability by reducing the environmental footprint associated with book production while fostering a sense of community among readers. The Book Renting Platform project seeks to revive the joy of reading physical books in a digitally connected world. The MERN stack's versatility and robustness will enable the development of a scalable and feature-rich platform that can adapt to the evolving needs of book enthusiasts.
